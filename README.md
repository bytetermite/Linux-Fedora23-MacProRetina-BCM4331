# Linux-Fedora23-MacProRetina-BCM4331
Kernel 4.2.6-301.fc23.x86_64

This is just my own quest to keep this driver working on my Mac Book Pro retina display running Fedora Core 23.
-I just upgraded the kernel and then the driver compilation has broken again.
From now on, I will keep it updated and available to others to benefit on this as easy as possible.

All this changes are from my own source code investigation and research on the internet. I will mention all sources when the fixes comes from web research.
