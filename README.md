# Linux-Fedora23-MacProRetina-BCM4331
Kernel 4.2.6-301.fc23.x86_64

This is just my own case to keep this drive working on my Mac Book Pro retina display running Fedora Core 23.
I just upgrade the kernel and driver compilation broke again.
From now on, I will keep it updated and available to others as easy as possible.

All this changes are from my own source investigation and research on the internet. I will mention all sources when the fixes comes from web research.
